# Planning 

Making fundamental breadboard that all the other parts are gonna rest on! This serves as the main 'breadboard' that everything else will be screwed onto. This is made to be able to host four mounting pins and is only 80x80mm so that people don't have to print out a lot of area they won't use (it's modular so people can make it bigger if they need to easily). The tolerances are kinda high because 3D printing, but it's easily editable because the tolerance is made with an offset on a triangle in the sketch.

Time: 35m

---------

Making the mounting stick for things in multiple lengths!

It's a weird threading because fusion dosent want to work with me but also honestly who cares? You should not be using metal screws with this since they're expensive and this is just plastic. You don't need the strength of metal and the tolerances will be bad no matter what. Plus, you can easily model threads for this since it's just a weird fusion setting, not some esoteric threading only obtainable by digging into fifteen menus on the fusion threading tool. 
Time: 20m

---------

Making a general purpose platform that attaches to four anchor points (can be used to glue on any mounts not designed with holes that I may design later)! If there's something oddly shaped or some heatsink that can rest flat on it, this is perfect (like some of the standard aluminium heatsinks that you can get with cheap high powered lasers).

Time: 10m

---------

Making laser and mirror mounts!
Made two TO-18 mounts (most common laser housing architecture), one threaded and one unthreaded, made a mirror mount and a mirror screw. The mirror screw has a square handle to help when doing small adjustments to align the mirrors properly. There's also two screw holes to help with that too in case you want it placed more precisely than just against one surface.

Time: 1.5hr

---------

Made a sample construction and cleaning up the github! Added more detail to the journal, wrote an actual readme, and worrying over messing anything up lol.

This design is a beam adder, assuming you use the proper mirrors and one where its partially reflective (to actually pass the beam through). 
Time: 3hr

---------

Made a simple platform. I was originally going to add slots for things like x-cubes or other blocks, but since it won't be moving around much I didn't think there was a point and just left it simple. If you need, just keep it down with a peice of tape or something.

Time: 10 mins?

---------

Modeled in the lasers and mirrors to the example circuit and specified the type of PLA in the BOM.

# Build 

8/11 and 8/12/25

Printing out parts. The tolerance on the edge nubs of the base plates (unsure if that's the right word but you get what I mean) could be a little smaller but not enough to ruin the usefulness. The tolerance on the mounting poles is too large though, so I updated the models. Went through this multiple times, including on the next day... They were first 10mm in diameter but that just couldn't fit into the screws on the build plates so then I tried 8mm which was too small and just slipped. 9mm worked the best and would screw in about half the distance and then get stuck/secure, probably due to 3D printed screws being weird.

8/14

Today I assembled everything, took the video, edited it together, and submitted everything I needed to do for highway. I also uploaded the laser mount I had made the previous time I was working on this. Images in the readme, and video on YT! 

Assembly was easy since it's just screws but I had to fidget with the threaded mounts a bit to get everything lined up. The leads from the laser to the battery were a little annoying because I didn't want to use electrical tape, but once I put the battery on the side it all worked easily. I tried using the 20mm mounting pole with the double slit card but that was too short so I just had to angle it on the 40mm card correctly. 

The video is just a collection of clips of me assembling and demoing the project. It's ~5 mins because I love yapping ;-;. 

Time: 1 hr
