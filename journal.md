Total time: ~5 hr

Making fundamental breadboard that all the other parts are gonna rest on! This serves as the main 'breadboard' that everything else will be screwed onto. This is made to be able to host four mounting pins and is only 80x80mm so that people don't have to print out a lot of area they won't use (it's modular so people can make it bigger if they need to easily).

Time: 35m


Making the mounting stick for things in multiple lengths!

It's a weird threading because fusion dosent want to work with me but also honestly who cares? You should not be using metal screws with this since the tolerances will be garbage anyways for a *real* optical breadboard. This is meant for low powered lasers! Also the threading is going to be in the readme so anyone can just 3D print new mounts if they want anyways. 
Time: 20m


Making a general purpose platform that attaches to four anchor points (can be used to glue on any mounts not designed with holes that I may design later)!

Time: 10m


Making laser and mirror mounts, plus any other random peices I think people might want
Made two TO-18 mounts (most common laser housing architecture), one threaded and one unthreaded, made a mirror mount and a mirror screw

Time: 1.5hr


Made a sample construction and cleaning up the github!

This design is a beam adder (assuming you use the proper mirrors)
