This is a 3D printable optical breadboard!

Optical breadboards are heavy metal plates with holes threaded into them meant to serve as a mounting place for mounts holding lasers, lenses, mirrors, and a whole host of other implements. They serve much the same purpose as normal breadboards: an easy place to test new designs and circuits without having to make custom PCBs or housings for them. The problem is, optical breadboards are often very expensive due to the material cost of all the metal used in them (which is meant to help eliminate vibrations). 

That is where plasticbread comes in! It serves as a 3D printable and modular breadboard that can be used to quickly test optical circuits involving low to mid powered lasers by hobbyists who cannot afford to spend hundreds of dollars on real breadboards. While the tolerances are higher and the vibrations will be larger, this is a viable alternative when you just need something that can easily mount your optical implements.

# BOM:
Literally just 3D printer filament lol. Rigid filaments, like PLA, are best for this. I use black PLA from Overture.
